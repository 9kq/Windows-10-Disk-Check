# Windows-10-Disk-Check

# If you put 'cd C: \ (no space) :i30:$bitmap' into something like CMD, it will trigger what is known as a "Disk Check".
# This will notify the user of a corrupted file or folder on the HDD/SSD by creating a corrupted table in the NTFS file system then have the user reboot for it to then scan the drive for that corrupted file/folder
# The media likes to say this will nuke your drive, but it is just a harmless gag/prank on your friends who aren't as skilled with computers as you are.
# Have fun!
